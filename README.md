# FinalProject
Calulate the subtotal for different shoe styles, add the tax (7%),
and then calculate the grand total after adding the subtotal and tax.
There are 6 different styles, all with different prices. You have to 
manually input the prices for each item as it appears on the screen. 

To calculate the amount, I created a variable that adds the items together 
to give you the subtotal. Then I created a tax variable that multiplies
your tax, 7%, to your subtotal. The total variable then adds your tax to 
your subtotal for your final grand total.
